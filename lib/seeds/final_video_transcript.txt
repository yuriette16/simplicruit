Hi, I am Linlu. I am having working as a customer service assistant for four years in a travel agency. A good customer service for me is to be able to empathize with your clients. In the travel industry, it's very common to cancel the trade due to the bad weather. Under those circumstances, I would always be willing to reach my clients and try to listen to their voice and share my own travel story and relatable experience, and then I would get on to rescheduling and modify the itinerary.

So at this point, I wanted to see over my career and I would definitely put all my efforts to whatever I'm good at solving the problem for my clients. Thank you.
